## Legends

- [HOBBY]: These are personal works I've done during my
free time. I don't care about any coding standards in
these if I don't feel like it. I just want to do things
or experiment with stuffs.  
- [TOOL]: These are tools that I written to be useful for
me. I just write them according to my needs so don't expect
a lot.  
- [HOMEWORK]: These are projects that are part of assignments,
exercises, or anything related to my studies. Some of them are
part of a group project while some are entirely mine. These
contains higher quality codes written by me since most of them
are judged by my lecturers.  
- [WORK]: These are projects that are part of the work I'm
commissioned to do by my clients.
