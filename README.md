started programming in high school.

> **Fav Language**: Python, Javascript, C/C++  
> **Hobby**: Coding, Drawing, Listening to Music  
> **Fav Musician**: Yorushika, Kenshi Yonezu, Panic! at The Disco  

## Legends

- **[HOBBY]**: These are personal works I've done during my
free time. I just want to do things or experiment with stuff.  
- **[TOOL]**: These are tools that I written to be useful for
me. I just write them according to my needs so don't expect
a lot of updates.  
- **[HOMEWORK]**: These are projects that are part of assignments,
exercises, or anything related to my studies. Some of them are
part of a group project while some are entirely mine. The codes
written by me are higher in quality and follow proper standards
since most of them are judged by my lecturers. Those that aren't
have codes with similar quality to my **[HOBBY]** repos.  
- **[WORK]**: These are projects that are part of the work I'm
commissioned to do by my clients.
